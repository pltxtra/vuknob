/*
 * This class is used to register a top level XML node type entry for satan projects.
 *
 * A top level entry will on request generate data to be stored in a project XML file.
 *
 * A top level entry will also provide a method to parse the same data back from an XML file.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * So - if you have a class created that you want should be able to save it's data into
 * a Satan Project, please create a static object of a class that inherits this one. That object
 * will be called each time a project is to be saved or loaded.
